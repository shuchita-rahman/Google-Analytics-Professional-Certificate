# 1. Problem-Solving and Effective Questioning
## 1.1 Learning Log: Consider what data means to you
#### Overview
 You have already started learning about how data can be used to answer questions. Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log to track your thinking and reflections about what data means to you and how it relates to problem-solving.
#### Data and Problem-Solving
Think for a moment about the word **data**. What does it mean to you?

Although it’s clear that data is a major part of a data analyst’s job, it’s only part of the big picture. The other part is problem solving. Being a successful data analyst means understanding that each problem is unique and working **methodically** to solve that problem with data. 

By definition, most new problems data analysts face start in unknown territory. It’s up to the data analyst and their problem solving skills to think strategically, ask good questions, and use data to come up with solutions to these problems. 

#### Guidance
Here are some question which will help you in the thinking process.
* How would you describe “data” to someone who is unfamiliar with the word?
* What does data represent?
* What is data used for?
* Where does data come from? 
* How do you get data?

Then write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) reflecting on the problem-solving process by answering each of the questions below:

* When you come across a problem and you aren’t sure of the answer or solution, what do you do? 
* How do you identify new and interesting problems to begin with? Is there a process you use to identify problems you want to solve? How do you feel about data?

# 2. Take Action with Data
## 2.1 Data in Action
Lets' look at an example how effective problem solving using data analysis phases *ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act* in action.
**Problem:** A small business of Anywhere Gaming repair which repair broken video game need more customers.
The business knew advertising is a proven way to get more customers, but the business wasn't sure where to start. Because there are different advertising strategies.
One of the key things to think about when choosing an advertising method is your **target audience**, in other words, the specific people you're trying to reach. For example, if a university wanted to reach students to attend their university, placing an ad in front high school would be a smart choice. Or if a catering company wanted to find new cooks, it might advertise using a poster at a bus stop near a cooking school. Both of these are great ways to get your ad seen by your target audience. 

The second thing to think about is your **budget** and how much the different advertising methods will cost. For example, a TV ad is likely to be more expensive than a radio ad. The business owner asked a data analyst, Shuchita, to make a recommendation.

**Solution**

**Ask:** Shuchita began by defining the problem that needed to be solved. To focus only to the problem first she zoom out and look at the whole situation. For this she had to collaborate with the stakeholders included the owner, the vice president of communication, and director of the marketing and finance. Working together, Shuchita and the stakeholders agreed on the problem, not knowing their target audience's preferred type of advertising.

**Prepare**:  In this phase, Shuchita collected data for the upcoming analysis process. 
* She needed to better understand the company's target audience, people with video game systems.
* After that, she collected data on the different advertising methods like radio ad, tv ad, billboards ad, etc costs.

**Process**: Here Shuchita cleaned the data by eliminating format error, outliers, etc. that could get in the way of the result. 

**Analyze:** In this step, Shuchita wanted to find out two things. 

**1.** Who's most likely to own a video gaming system?
> Between the ages of 18 and 34 are most likely to make video game related purchases. She could confirm that anwhere gaming repairs' target audience was people 18-34 years old. 

**2.** Where are these people most likely to see an advertisement? 

> TV commercials and podcasts are very popular with people in the target audience.

As the business has limited budget, she recommend podcasts for advertising.

**Share:** As now she has the answer she made clear and compelling visuals of the analysis to helped the stakeholders to understand the solution.

**Action**: *Anywhere Gaming Repair* took action, they worked with a local podcast production agency to create a 30 second ad about their services. The ad ran on podcast for a month. They saw an increase in customers after just the first week. By the end of the month, they had 90 new customers.

THere you go , Effective problem solving using data analysis phases in action.

# 2.2 From Issue to Action: The 6 data analysis phases
These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called **structured thinking**. This process involves four basic activities:

* Recognizing the current problem or situation
* Organizing available information 
* Revealing gaps and opportunities
* Identifying your options

#### Step-1: Ask 

Things you need to consider if you don't know what the problem is:

* Define the problem you’re trying to solve.
* Make sure to understand stakeholders expectation.
* Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
* Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
* Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 

* What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
* Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

#### Step-2: Prepare
You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 
* What metrics(**Metrics** set the parameters for the data your organization will use to measure performance. Let's say you're looking to measure the performance of your talent acquisition (TA) team. An important metric to look at would be time to fill.) to measure?
* Locate data in your database ?
* Create security measures to protect that data.

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 

* What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
* What research do I need to do?

#### Step-3: Process
You need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:
* Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data.
* Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces.
* Removing repeated entries.
* Checking as much as possible for bias in the data.

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
* What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
* How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

#### Step-4: Analyze
At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 
* Perform calculations
* Combine data from multiple sources
* Create tables with your results

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
* What story is my data telling me?
* How will my data help me solve this problem?
* Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

#### Step-5: Share
Sharing will certainly help your team:  
* Make better decisions
* Make more informed decisions
* Lead to stronger outcomes
* Successfully communicate your findings

 Questions to ask yourself in this step:
* How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
* What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

#### Step-6: Act

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
* How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

# 3. Solve Problems with Data
## 3.1 Common problem types

Data analytics is so much more than just plugging information into a platform to find insights. It is about solving problems. And when getting to the root of these problems and finding practical solutions, there are lots of opportunities for creative thinking. No matter the problem, the first and most important step is understanding what types of problem you are dealing with. There is six types of problem a data analyst will face.

![](problem_type.png)!

Source: [Six Problem Types](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/supplement/IggXC/six-problem-types)

**1.Making predictions** 

A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

**2.Categorizing things**

An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

**3.Spotting something unusual** 

A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

**4.Identifying themes** 

User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. 

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is this: Categorizing things involves assigning items to categories. Identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

**5.Discovering connections** 

A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 

**6.Finding patterns**

Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window. 

# 4. Craft Effective Questions
## 4.1 SMART Questions

We already know six problem types. Now we will learn how we should ask questions to find answers to the problem. Suppose,

*Which flavor do you prefer Chocolate or Vanilla?*

You couldn't answer the question. Because you don't know which food he/she is talking about ice cream, pudding or, coffee.  You might enjoy chocolate flavor ice cream but for coffee, you like vanilla flavor. 
This type of question isn't effective to find a solution. So, to become a data analyst you need to know how to ask effective questions.

Effective questions follow the SMART methodology.

Lets Breakdown SMART methodology

#### Specific: 
Specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. This helps us collect information that's relevant to what we're investigating.

*Are kids getting enough physical activities these days?* :heavy_multiplication_x:

*Ask what percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week?* :heavy_check_mark:

#### Measurable
Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed. For example,

*Why did a recent video go viral?* :heavy_multiplication_x:

*How many times was our video shared on social channels the first week it was posted?* :heavy_check_mark:
#### Action
Action-oriented questions encourage change.
*How can we get customers to recycle our product packaging?* :heavy_multiplication_x:

*What design features will make our packaging easier to recycle?* :heavy_check_mark:

#### Relevant
Relevant questions are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve. For example, you're working on a problem related to a threatened species of frog.

*Why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing?* :heavy_multiplication_x:

*North Carolina between 1983 and 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from the Sandhills Regions?* :heavy_check_mark:

#### Time-Bound
Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied. 
The time period we want to study is 1983 to 2004. 

# 4.2 Things to avoid when asking questions

**Leading questions:** Questions that only have a particular response.

**Example:** 
*This product is too expensive, isn’t it?* :heavy_multiplication_x:

This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question.

*What is your opinion of this product?* :heavy_check_mark:

There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?” This question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

**Closed-ended questions**: Questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only.

**Example:** 
*Were you satisfied with the customer trial?* :heavy_multiplication_x:

This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. 

*What did you learn about customer experience from the trial?* :heavy_check_mark:

This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

**Vague questions:** questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

**Example:** *Does the tool work for you?* :heavy_multiplication_x:

This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know. 

*Is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool?* :heavy_check_mark:

*If faster, how much time is saved?* :heavy_check_mark:

*If slower, how much time is lost?* :heavy_check_mark:

These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).

# 4.3 Self- Reflection
Consider the scenario above:

* Based on the SMART framework, which questions are most important to ask? 
* How will these questions clarify the requirements and goals for the project?
* How does asking detailed, specific questions benefit you when planning for a project? Can vague or unclear questions harm a project?

**Solutions:** 

1. Relevant.
2. Specific: It helps us to see the whole situation and understand what stakeholders need.
Measurable: Help us to see the concrete number a problem is causing.
Action: Help us to stay goal-oriented.
Relevant: Help us to remove unnecessary matters of a situation.
Time-bound: Help us to understand when the problem is started.
3. Yes, vague or unclear questions can harm a project.

# 4.4 Self-Reflection: Ask Your Own SMART Questions

Suppose you know a person in your life who uses data for better life decisions. You want to let him/her know that you are trying to be a data analyst and applying these skills in your daily life.
**How will you start the conversation?**
#### Plan for the conversation

First, decide who you will speak with and how they might use data. Your goal is to plan for a successful conversation. Think about how much time you need and how you will use it. For this step, review the following advice:

* **Prioritize your questions:** Prepare to ask the most important and interesting questions first.

* **Make your time count:** Stay on the subject during the conversation.

* **Clarify your understanding:** To avoid confusion, build in some time to summarize answers to make sure you understood them correctly. This will go a long way in helping you avoid mistakes. For example, in a conversation with a teacher, you might check your understanding with a statement like, “Just to double-check that I understand what you’re saying correctly, you currently use test scores in the following ways…”

Depending on the field they are in, the person you chat with may not be comfortable sharing detailed data with you. That's okay! Be sure to respect what they are willing to share during your conversation.

As a reminder, SMART questions are

* **Specific:** Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
* **Measurable:** Questions can be quantified and assessed.
* **Action-oriented:** Questions encourage change.
* **Relevant:** Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you’re trying to solve. 
* **Time-bound:** Questions specify the time to be studied.

For instance, if you have a conversation with someone who works in retail, you might lead with questions like: 

* **Specific:** Do you currently use data to drive decisions in your business? If so, what kind(s) of data do you collect, and how do you use it?
* **Measurable:** Do you know what percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?
* **Action-oriented:** Are there business decisions or changes that you would make if you had the right information? For example, if you had information about how umbrella sales change with the weather, how would you use it?
* **Relevant:** How often do you review data from your business?
* **Time-bound:** Can you describe how data helped you make good decisions for your store(s) this past year?

If you are having a conversation with a teacher, you might ask different questions, such as: 

* **Specific:** What kind of data do you use to build your lessons?
* **Measurable:** How well do student benchmark test scores correlate with their grades?
* **Action-oriented:** Do you share your data with other teachers to improve lessons?
* **Relevant:** Have you shared grading data with an entire class? If so, do students seem to be more or less motivated, or about the same?
* **Time-bound:** In the last five years, how many times did you review data from previous academic years?

 If you are having a conversation with a small business owner of an ice cream shop, you could ask:

* **Specific:** What data do you use to help with purchasing and inventory?
* **Measurable:** Can you order (rank) these factors from most to least influential on sales: price, flavor, and time of year (season)?
* **Action-oriented:** Is there a single factor you need more data on so you can potentially increase sales?
* **Relevant:** How do you advertise to or communicate with customers?
* **Time-bound:** What does your year-over-year sales growth look like for the last three years?


It is important to take good notes during your conversation. Your notes should be comprehensive, useful, and capture meaning. 

> *If a question is worth asking, then the answer is worth recording. Commit yourself to taking great notes during your conversation.* 

Helpful aspects of your conversation to note include:

* **Facts:** Write down any concrete piece of information, such as **dates**, **times**, **names**, and other specifics.
* **Context:**  Note any relevant details that are needed in order to understand the information you gather.

* **Unknowns:** Sometimes you may miss an important question during a conversation. Make a note when this happens so you can figure out the answer later. 


#### Reflection

Before you begin your conversation about data, consider each of the above steps. Think about potential candidates, brainstorm some SMART questions, and get an idea of the information you want to record during your conversation. Then, reflect on your conversation:

* What SMART questions did you ask? How did these questions tie into the field of the person you chatted with? 
* What insights did you discover during your conversation? 
* How did the SMART framework help you arrive at your conclusions?

**Solutions**

I talked with a person who always keep his diabetes in control. I wanted to know how he does that.

1. SMART question I have asked : 
   
   * **Specific:**  What type of data do you use before taking your insulin shot?
   *    **Measurable:** Does your insulin intake is  correlated with your diabetes?
   *    **Action:** Do you thare your data with your doctor?
   *    **Relevant:** Do you increase/decrease your walking time after seeing the data?
   * **Time:** Can you describe how this data help your doctor to give you proper treatment?
   
2. I have learned that he check his glucose level every week before breakfast and after breakfast. That's how he decides how much insulin he is going to take. He walked every day for one hour. Last he consults with his doctor every 6 with this data. 

3. SMART methodology helped me stay focus on the solution one must take to control their diabetes.
