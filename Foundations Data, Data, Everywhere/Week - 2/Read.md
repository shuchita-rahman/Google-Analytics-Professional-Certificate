# Introduction 

Last week you got solid foundation about what is data, in this week you will learn how to think analytically. We will begin with five analytical skill which will help you think like analyticsf. Plus you will see some real life example and discover your natural abilities in this area.

# 1.Embracing Data Analytical Skills
### 1.1 Key Data Analyst Skills
Sometimes when people try to learn new skills, they overlook their own skill. As you are learning how to be a data analyst you might not know that you are more prepared than you think. Lets, dive into to see how much prepare you are
So,**What is Analytical Skills?** 
> Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts.

There are lot of aspects in analytical skills. But in this course we'll focus on five essential points.
1. Curiosity, 
2. Understanding Context,
3. Having a Technical Mindset,
4. Data Design, and
5. Data Strategy.

Let's see if you have these skills or not.

**Curiosity**: Curiosity is the urge you feel to know more about something. Curious people always seek out new challenges which lead them to knowledge.
For Example, you're here with me for demonstrates that you have curiosity.

**Understanding Context**: Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. To make sense of the world, you're always trying to place things in context, whether it's the environment, culture, or something else together. For example, you asked your friend to count one through five.
> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

But your friend decided to count like below,
> 1, 2, 4, 5, 3

You would probably notice 3 is out of context and if this bothering you, chances are you understand the context.

**Having a Technical Mindset**: Technical mindset is breaking things down into smaller steps then worked with them orderly and logically. For example, you want to 

**Data Design** : Data design is how you organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database. But, again, the same skills can easily be applied to everyday life. For example, think about the way you organize the contacts in your phone. That's actually a type of data design. Maybe you list them by first name instead of last, or maybe you use email addresses instead of their names. What you're really doing is designing a clear, logical list that lets you call or text a contact in a quick and simple way.

**Data Strategy**:  Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis. Let's break that down. You manage people by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions to the problem you're working on. For processes, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible. For tools, you make sure the right technology is being used for the job. Now, you may be doubting my ability to give you an example from real life that demonstrates data strategy. But check this out.

# 2. Thinking about Analytical Thinking
You already learn the five skills of a data analyst. Now you are ready to learn how to think analytically. Thinking is our second nature. People think about thinking. Because of people's personalities, everyone thinks differently. Some people think creatively, some people think logically and some people think matters in an abstract way. In this section, you will learn how to think analytically. Let's dive into it
### 2.1 All about Analytical Thinking
**Definition**: Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using an organized and step-by-step manner.

So, How do data analysts think analytically? Again there are a set of 5 skills for thinking analytically. These are
1. Visualization,
2. Strategy,
3. Problem-Orientation,
4. Correlation, and
5. Big Picture and Detailed-Oriented Thinking.

**Visualization**: In data analysis, visualization is the process of building a graph, chart, or other visualization formats that help to interpret the data. For example, you want someone to explain what is Grand Canyon. Now telling them with words could be difficult but showing the picture of the Grand Canyon is much easier to understand. 

**Strategy**: Strategy is a general plan to achieve one or more long-term or overall goals under conditions. With so much data available, having a strategic mindset is the key **staying focus and on track**. Strategizing helps data analysts to achieve the goal they want from the data and also utilize the best from the data.

**Problem-Orientation**: Having an emphasis towards or a design based on problems. Data analysts use the problem-orientation approach to identify, describe and solve a problem. Their top priority in mind is solving the problem. For example, in a warehouse, there is always sort of supplies. Now data analysts will ask many questions, move forward with many strategies but the main goal is to find a way to keep inventory on shelves.

**Correlation**: It's a mutual connection between two or more things. A correlation is like a relationship. Being able to find a correlation between data leads to more pieces of information. For example, does rain affect umbrella selling? Or, Is your stress increase your caffeine intact? An important thing we need to keep in mind correlation is not equal to **causation**(the action of causing something). Just because two graphs going in the same direction doesn't mean they are related. 

**Big Picture and Detailed-Oriented Thinking**: It means being able to see the big picture as well as the details. A jigsaw puzzle is a great way to think about this. Big-picture thinking is like looking at a complete puzzle. You can enjoy the whole picture without getting stuck on every tiny piece that went into making it. If you only focus on individual pieces, you wouldn't be able to see past that, which is why big-picture thinking is so important. It helps you zoom out and see possibilities and opportunities. This leads to exciting new ideas or innovations. On the flip side, detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan. In other words, the pieces that make up your puzzle. There are all kinds of problems in the business world that can benefit from employees who have both a big-picture and a detail-oriented way of thinking. Most of us are naturally better at one or the other. But you can always develop the skills to fit both pieces together.
### 2.2 Exploring core analytical skills
You already know that different people take different approaches to think. Now suppose you are a logical thinker but sometimes the problem needs to solve creatively. So how can you do that? You can grow and develop your thinking pattern. You might naturally be an analytical thinker, but you can learn to think creatively and critically and be great at all three. The more ways you can think, the easier it is to think outside the box and come up with fresh ideas. **Why it necessary?**

 >Because in data analysis, solutions are rarely right in front of you. You need to think critically to find out the right questions to ask. But you also need to think creatively to get new and unexpected answers.
 
 Example of some questions a data analyst might ask:
1. What is the root cause of a problem?
2. Where is the gap in our process?
3. What did we not consider before?

Now let's see how they will find the answer to these questions.

**1. What is the root cause of a problem?**

Data analysis use **5 why's answer** to solve this problem. For example, you want to make a blueberry pie but you couldn't make it.

>**Why number-1: Why can't I make blueberry pie?**
>>The store doesn't enough blueberries.

>**Why number-2: Why there are no blueberries at the store?**
>>Blueberry bushes don't have enough blueberry this season.

>**Why number-3: Why there aren't enough blueberries in blueberry bushes?**
>>Birds are eating all the blueberries.

>**Why number-4: Why Birds are eating blueberries?**
>>Normally birds eat mulberries. As there are not enough mulberries so birds are eating blueberries now.

>**Why number-5: Why there are not enough mulberries in the trees**
>>Because, late frost damaged the mulberry bushes. So this is the reason why you can't make a blueberry pie.

**2. Where is the gap in our process**

This is called gap analysis. Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently to get where you want to be in the future. **The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to and where you want to be**. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.

**3. What did we not consider before?**

This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward. 

These are a few questions data analysts use in everyday life. You will see more as you progress with this course.
# 3. Thinking about the Outcome
In earlier, section you learned five data analytical skills *Curiosity,* *Understanding Context,* *Having Technical Mindset,* *Data Design* and *Data Strategy*. In this section you will learn how these skills guide you to **data driven decision making**.

## 3.1 Using data to drive successful outcomes
These are just some of the benefits of data-driven decision-making. It gives you greater confidence about your choice and your abilities to address business challenges. For example, say a dairy farmer wants to start making and selling ice cream. They could guess what flavors customers would like, but there's a better way to get the information. The farmer could survey people and ask them what flavors they prefer. This gives the farmer the data they need to pick ice cream flavors people will enjoy. n say a dairy farmer wants to start making and selling ice cream.

This gives the farmer the data they need to pick ice cream flavors people will enjoy. 
## 3.2 Real-world data magic
In this section we will see some case study in real life. It will help you to how much power data analyst have.

**Case - 1:** In Google, the HR department wanted to know if there was value in having managers. Or should everyone just be an individual contributor?

Google's people analytics team looked at past performance reviews and employee surveys. The data they found was plotted on a graph because as you've learned, visuals are extremely helpful when trying to understand a problem or concept. The graph revealed that Googlers had positive feelings about their managers, but the data was pretty general and the team wanted to learn more.

So they dug deeper and split the data into quartiles. A quartile divides data points into four equal parts or quarters. Here's where the really cool stuff started happening. The data analysts discovered that there was a big difference between the very top and the very bottom quartiles. As it turned out, the teams with the best managers were significantly happier, more productive, and more likely to want to keep working at Google. This confirmed that managers were valued and make a big difference. **Therefore, the idea of having only individual contributors was not implemented**
