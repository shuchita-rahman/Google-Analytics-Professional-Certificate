# 1.Data analyst job opportunities

## 1.1 The job of a data analyst

Real companies are already using data analytics to stay ahead of the curve. And the more they use data in their business, the more they understand just how important data analyst like you are to their success.Ex:

**Coca-Cola:** You know those high tech Coca-Cola vending machines you see at movie theater sometimes? Which allows users to make their own flavor.
 Coca-Cola sees all the different kinds of flavor combinations people are coming up with, which they can then use as inspiration for new products. That's how Coca-Cola uses data gathered information from consumer feedback to create advertising that speaks directly to different audiences with different interests.
 There are other sectors where data can be used. For instance, *Healthcare, Marketing, Airline*, etc.

 # 1.3 Self-Reflection: Business use of data
 
 #### How a business uses data
 In this self-reflection, you’ll consider the businesses you interact with day-to-day and reflect on how they use data to improve their customer experience. 

Pick a company, service, or product that you've had personal experience with that uses data to improve its customer service. Some examples are local restaurants, health care providers, internet providers, or your favorite smartphone app.

Then, think of a specific customer experience problem this company, service or product might have that you suspect could be addressed with data. This could be something like a restaurant tracking sales of a new product, or internet service providers trying to figure out where outages occur. 

Try to avoid broad problems and think of specific issues. A good example of a problem would be that the meal you ordered from a delivery service arrived cold.
#### Reflection

Consider the company, service, or product you chose in this reflection:

* How could it use data to improve customer experience?
* What kinds of data would it need to collect? 
* How could insights from that data solve a problem?

#### Example Solution: 
Service: Internet Provider

Problem: Users need to go personally to pay the bill.
1. They could ask if the most of the user has bkash account(money delivery service) or not.
2. The data will be Q & A of a customer when they apply for their internet service.
3. If most of the answer is positive then they should create bkash service to pay the bill which customer can do from setting home or the customer don't need a back account to solve the problem.

  > There's so many different paths that you can take from the starting point that you really can't predict your end.
  
## 1.4 Learning Log: Reflect on the data analysis process
#### The data analysis process so far
In reviewing the data analysis process so far, you have already performed a lot of these steps. Here are some examples to think about before you begin writing your learning log entry: 

* You asked an interesting question and defined a problem to solve through data analysis to answer that question. 
* You thought deeply about what data you would need and how you would collect it in order to prepare for analysis.
* You processed your data by organizing and structuring it in a table and then moving it to a spreadsheet. 
* You analyzed your data by inspecting and scanning it for patterns.
* You shared your first data visualization: a bar chart.

Finally, after completing all the other steps, you acted: You reflected on your results, made decisions, and gained insight into your problem--even if that insight was that you didn't have enough data, or that there were no obvious patterns in your data.

#### Reflection

* Which part(s) of the data analysis process did you enjoy the most? What did you enjoy about it? 
* What were some of the key ideas you learned in this course?
* Are there concepts or portions of the content that you would like to learn more about? If so, what are they? Which upcoming course do you think would teach you the most about this area?
* Now that you’ve gained experience doing data analysis, how do you feel about becoming a data analyst? Have your feelings changed since you began this course? If so, how?

# 2.2 Importance of Fair Business Decisions
## 2.1 The Power of Data in Business
Let's think back on the real examples of businesses using data analytics and their operation we've seen before.In every example there have common theme.
They are **issue, questions**,and **problem**.

**Issue:** A topic or subject you need to investigate.

**Questions:** Design to discover information

**Problem:** An obstacle that need to be workout to solve.

Let's think about past example, Coca-Cola need new flavor to make which their customers already like. 
Data analytics gave them the information they needed to find the best possible solution to their problem. That's the power of data. 
> Observation and intuition are powerful tools and decision-making, but they can only take us so far when we make decisions based on just observation and gut feelings, we're only seeings part of the picture. But data analysis give us the whole picture of why the problem is causing and how to solve it.

## 2.2 Understanding Data and Fairness
We already know how data-driven decision-making is necessary for business tasks. Sometimes data-driven decision-making can be biased and unfair. You can ask yourself why it's not fair because data-driven decision-making comes from facts. So, what is fairness means in data analysis  
>  Fairness means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. This requires using processes and systems that are fair and inclusive.
Lets' look at an example, how data can be unfair :

A company is known for boys club. 

**Task:** This company wants to see which employees are doing well, 
so they start gathering data on employee performance and their own company culture. 

**Analysis:** The data shows that men are the only people succeeding at this company. 

**Conclusion:** They should hire more men because they are doing well here. 

Why this conclusion is not fair? 
**First**, It paints an incomplete picture and doesn't even consider all of the available data on company culture.  
**Second**, it doesn't think about the other surrounding factors that impact the data. The conclusion doesn't consider the difficulties that people of different gender identities have trying to navigate a toxic work environment. 
The conclusion that only men are 
succeeding at this company is true, 
but it ignores other systematic factors 
that are contributing to this problem. 

**Fair way**, 

>An ethical data analyst can look at the data gathered and 
conclude that the company culture is preventing some employees from succeeding, and the company needs to address those problems to boost performance.

## 2.3 Self-Reflection: Business Cases

Consider these case study and answer these questions:

* What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
* How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

#### Case Study-1 

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good). 

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.
Consider this scenario: 

**Reflection:**

1. The data is not fair because out of 45, 26 teachers didn't attend the workshop. So if we average the rating by dividing the participation it doesn't give us a proper rating.
2. The data analyst needs to find out why most teachers didn't feel like attending the workshop.

#### Case Study-2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadways—specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions. 

**Reflections:**
1. Company didn't collect data for nighttime.
2. The data analyst has to collect the same data for nighttime.

#### Case Study-3

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitors’ interests, the park develops a survey. 

They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

**Reflection**
1. They didn't try to find out who is their target audience. And the visitors who aren't coming might have a reason for not enjoying the ride the park already has. So asking only those who are already visiting the amusement park is unfair.
2. The data analyst could ask "I will come to the amusement park if it has this ride?" to those people who aren't coming to the amusement park.
