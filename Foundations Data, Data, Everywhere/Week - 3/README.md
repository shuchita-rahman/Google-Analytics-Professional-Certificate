# Introduction 

In note 1, we learn about the data analysis process. Quick refresher, they are *Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act*.  In this week, we will learn about the data life cycle. To bring data to life analysts, use different tools like spreadsheets, databases, query languages, visualization software. It's okay if you don't know about these tools. We will talk about what these tools are and how to use them.

# 1.Follow the data life cycle
## 1.1 Phases of the data life cycle
If we carefully check, everything has a life cycle. The most common example is the life cycle of a butterfly. ![Butter Flies Life Cycle](Cycle.jpeg)

Data also have their life cycle. The data life cycle consists of six phases.
1. Plan
2. Capture
3. Manage
4. Analyze
5. Archive 
6. Destroy

**Plan**: Planning happen before the project even starts. In this phase business will decides 
* What kind of data it needs in the project?
* How they are going to manage them ?
* Who is responsible for managing the data throughout the project?


**Capture:** This is where data are collected from various resources. Business will asked these questions 
* Where does their data come from?
* How will they get it?


**Manage:** In these phase it all about storing the capture data. Business will decide
* How will they store this data?
* What should it be used for? 
* How do they keep this data secure and protected?

**Analyze:** In this phase analysts solve the problem to support business goal. Here analysts shine the most. In this phase analysts will ask these question.
* How will the company analyze the data?
* What tools should they use?

**Archive:** Some data is not frequently use in a project. If we have to sort through data all the time it will bring hazard. So business should store those data which is not use frequently in a place where it’s available but may not be use again. These is called archiving. It will protect data and simplify the data base. In this phase analysts would ask these question
* What should they do with their data when it gets old?
* How do they know when it's time?

**Destroy:** Now it’s shocking to hear that business have to destroy the data that they have collected. Its important to destroy the data because it will keep companies data private. Business use data erase software tools to destroy. But if they have any hard copy of the data companies need shred to maintain privacy. Question need to ask
* Should they ever dispose of any data?
* If so, when and how?




## 1.2 Self-Reflection: Collecting data

### **Overview**

Now that you are familiar with the phases of the data life cycle, you can take a moment to think about your learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about collecting data and how data collection fits into the data life cycle.

To start, you will consider a simple scenario: discussing the data life cycle in a mock interview for a data analyst role. Then, you will respond to **three brief questions**. You’ve done the hard work to learn the basics of the data life cycle, so get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick! 

#### **The scenario: interview for a data analyst position**

Imagine that you interview for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. The hiring manager explains that the company needs a data analyst because they want to learn more about their customers. 
> First, they want to understand their customers’ ice cream flavor preferences. 

>Then, they will use this customer data to help make important decisions. 

The hiring manager explains that they do not collect any customer data, and they don’t know where to begin. The hiring manager asks you: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?

Before responding to the question, you consider each step of the data life cycle *Planning, Capturing, Managing, Analyzing, Archiving and Destroing.*

#### Reflection

Consider your learning about the steps of the data life cycle and reflect on the hiring manager’s request. Review the following questions to help guide your thinking: 

* What kind of data should they gather? 
* How should they gather this data? 
* Where will the data live? How will they store the data?
* Once they have the data, how will they use it? 
* How do they keep their data secure and protected? 
* What should they do with old data? What are their options?

Below a sample answer is given but, it is not the only answer of the question.

**Answer** :The ice cream company needs data from those conventional stores where their company's ice creams are sold regularly. They need to ask those stores for the consecutive order of the stocking out ice creams flavors'.

# 2.Outlining the Data Analysis Process
In this section, we will learn about **Data Analysis Process**. The Data Analysis Process is not a part of the *Data Life Cycle* though it sounds similar. This Google Analytic program is moduled around data analysis process.

## 2.1 Six phases of Data Analysis

**Ask**: In this phase, you as an analyst need to make sure of these two things.
  >  1.  Defining the problem.
  >  2.  Understanding stakeholders' need expectations.
  
First, to define the problem you need to understand what is the current state of the problem and how it's different from the final state. The obstacles you will face and how you will get rid of those things.  For instance, your doctor advised you to reduce your caffeine consumption. So the obstacle here is to find out when you increase your caffeine consumption. 
Second, You need to understand who are the stakeholders. The stakeholders' are those people who invested their time and resources into this project. For instance, the company's manager, sponsor of the project, or sales partner. You have to communicate with them and make sure you are on the track thorough out the project.

**Prepare**:In this phase, you will find out which type of data is important to continue the project. And how this data need to be unbiased.

**Process**: This phase is where you clean your data. Analysts tried to eliminate any typo, inaccuracy, inconsistency and error which can get in the way. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information. After that analysts share the data with the stakeholders.

**Analyze**: Now you have the datasets. You will try to transform, predict, or visualize the datasets to find out the answer.

**Share**: In this phase you will share your knowledge with the stakeholders.
**Act**: Now you know the solution you will act upon to meet the end goal.

# 2.4 Learning Log: Organize Your Data in a Table
**Overview**

By now, you have started to think about data in your daily life and how you use this data to make decisions. Earlier in this course, you completed a learning log where you recorded some data from your daily life. Next, you will consider how to organize this data. 
#### Structuring your data

To get started, consider the data you have collected in your learning log entries so far in this course. Now, take a moment and prepare to organize this data. One of the simplest ways to add structure to your data is to put it in a table.

To record your data in a table, you need to understand how a table is structured:

1. A table consists of rows and columns.
2. Each row is a different observation.
3. Each column is a different attribute of that observation.

For example, here is a collection of observations in a learning log about how many cups of coffee are consumed each day:

* 10/19, 2.5 cups of coffee
* 10/20, 2 cups of coffee
* 10/21, 1 cup of coffee
* 10/22, 1.5 cups of coffee
* 10/23, 1.5 cups of coffee


There are five data points. 
# 3. The Data Analysts Toolbox
## 3.1 Key data analyst tools
**Spreadsheets:** Data analysts rely on spreadsheets to collect and organize data. Two popular spreadsheet applications you will probably use a lot in your future role as a data analyst are **Microsoft Excel** and **Google Sheets**. 

Digital worksheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you 
* Collect, store, organize, and sort information.
* Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
* Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.

**Databases and query languages** : A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

Query languages 

* Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
* Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
* Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis


**Visualization tools**:  Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.
These tools 

* Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand 
* Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies  
* Have multiple features 

    - **Tableau's** simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and
   worksheets.
    - **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual 
## 3.2 Choosing the Right Tool for the Job
As a data analyst, you need to choose tool as per the need of your project. Suppose you have to clean, transform and visualize the data. Now you are left with the option using either spreadsheets or query languages.

| Spreadsheets                               | Databases                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Software applications                      | Data stores - accessed using a query language (e.g. SQL) |
| Structure data in a row and column format  | Structure data using rules and relationships             |
| Organize information in cells              | Organize information in complex collections              |
| Provide access to a limited amount of data | Provide access to huge amounts of data                   |
| Manual data entry                          | Strict and consistent data entry                         |
| Generally one user at a time               | Multiple users                                           |
| Controlled by the user                     | Controlled by a database management system               |

# 3.3 Self Reflection
#### data analysis process and data life cycle
While the data analysis process drives our projects and helps us reach our business goals, we have to understand the life cycle of the data we’ll be working with in order to use that process. We can’t analyze our data well if we don’t have a thorough understanding of our data. Similarly, we can collect all the data we want, but the data becomes worthless if we don’t have a good plan for analyzing the data. 

#### Ask and plan
Each phase happens before starting the project and these phases define the problem.Both phases involve planning, and asking questions.
In the planning phase, businesses decide who is going to manage the data throughout the project plus what kind of data they need, but in the ask phase businesses don't talk about data rather they focus on the problem they are facing and how to reach the goal state.

 They are different in that the ‘Ask’ phase in the data analysis process focuses on “big picture” strategic thinking about business goals, while the “Plan” phase focuses on “nuts and bolts” of the project, like what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you’re going to get it.
